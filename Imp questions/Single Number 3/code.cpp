// One important point is that by XORing all the numbers, 
// we actually get the XOR of the two target numbers 
// (because XORing two duplicate numbers always results 
// in 0). Consider the XOR result of the two target
//  numbers; if some bit of the XOR result is 1, it
//   means that the two target numbers differ at that 
//   location.

// Letâ€™s say the at the ith bit, the two desired 
// numbers differ from each other. which means one 
// number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has 
// bit i equaling 1.

// Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two 
// groups according to their bits at location i.
// the first group consists of all numbers whose 
// bits at i is 0.the second group consists of all 
// numbers whose bits at i is 1.

// Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0,
//  then, two copies of it will belong to the first 
//  group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit 
//  i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the 
//  second group.
