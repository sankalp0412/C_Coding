A subarray has Order and Continuity. A subsequence has Order but not Continuity. A subset does not Order nor Continuity. Save this answer.

Every Subarray is a Subsequence.
Every Subsequence is a Subset.











DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUBSET AND COMBINATIONS:

Subsets and combinations are both concepts used in mathematics and set theory, but they have different meanings and applications.

Subsets:
A subset is a collection of elements that are selected from a given set. Every set is considered a subset of itself, and the empty set (∅) is a subset of every set. Subsets can contain any number of elements, including none or all of the elements from the original set. In other words, a subset is formed by selecting some or all of the elements from a set, without any specific ordering or arrangement.

For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, some of its subsets include:

∅ (empty set)
{1}
{2, 3}
{1, 2}
{1, 3}
{1, 2, 3} (the original set)
Combinations:
Combinations, on the other hand, refer to the selection of a specific number of elements from a larger set, without regard to the order in which they are selected. Combinations are often used when you want to select a subset of elements for a particular purpose, such as forming a team, choosing a committee, or creating a menu.

For example, if you have a set {A, B, C, D}, some combinations of two elements (2-element combinations) would be:

AB
AC
AD
BC
BD
CD
Combinations differ from subsets because they involve selecting a specific number of elements from a set, whereas subsets can contain any number of elements.

In summary, subsets refer to all possible collections of elements from a set, while combinations specifically involve selecting a predetermined number of elements from a set, without regard to their order.

DIFF BETWEEN PERMUATATIONS AND COMBINATIONS:

No, permutations are different from combinations. Permutations and combinations are both mathematical concepts used to count and arrange elements, but they have distinct meanings and applications.

Permutations:
Permutations refer to the arrangement of elements from a set in a specific order. In permutations, the order of the elements matters. Each arrangement of the elements is considered a distinct permutation.

For example, given the set {A, B, C}, some permutations of the elements would be:

ABC
ACB
BAC
BCA
CAB
CBA
In permutations, the number of possible arrangements depends on the number of elements and can be calculated using factorial notation. The number of permutations of n elements taken r at a time is given by n! / (n - r)!, where n! denotes the factorial of n.

Combinations:
Combinations, as mentioned earlier, involve selecting a specific number of elements from a larger set without regard to the order in which they are selected. In combinations, the order of the elements does not matter. If the same elements are selected, but in a different order, it is still considered the same combination.

For example, considering the set {A, B, C}, some combinations of two elements (2-element combinations) would be:

AB
AC
BC
Combinations are often used when the order of selection is irrelevant, such as when choosing a committee from a group of people or selecting items from a menu.

The number of combinations of n elements taken r at a time can be calculated using the formula n! / (r! * (n - r)!).

In summary, permutations involve arranging elements in a specific order, where the order matters, while combinations involve selecting elements without regard to their order, where the order does not matter.





User
so {A,B} and {B,A} will be differenct permutation but same combination
ChatGPT
That's correct. In permutations, the order of the elements matters, so {A, B} and {B, A} would be considered different permutations because the order of the elements is different.

However, in combinations, the order of the elements does not matter. Therefore, {A, B} and {B, A} would be considered the same combination because they contain the same elements, regardless of their order.
